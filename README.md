# Fluxo

**Fluxo** is a dead-simple Kanban web app with one mission: be clean, straightforward, and brutally efficient for personal tasks and projects.

I needed a tool that just works — no bloat, no visual noise, no features I'll never use. Nothing out there fit. So I built it myself.

If you want enterprise bells, team collab, or 50 integrations, go use Trello, Notion, or Jira.  
Fluxo does **one thing** and does it right: minimal personal Kanban.

### Why Fluxo?
- Zero bloat, zero trackers
- Powerful filters (board-wide or per-column)
- Fully free · open source · PWA-ready
- Runs offline, fits in your pocket

### Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Deploy: Railway / Render (free tier)
